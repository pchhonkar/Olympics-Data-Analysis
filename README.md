# Olympics-Data-Analysis
Welcome to the Olympics Data Analysis project! This project leverages Streamlit to explore, analyze, and visualize Olympics data interactively, using powerful Python libraries and Machine Learning techniques to extract meaningful insights.

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Olympics data and uncover trends, patterns, and key insights using advanced visualization and predictive modeling. The interactive Streamlit dashboard provides tools for users to explore:

Trends in Olympic Data: Historical medal counts, country performance, and more.
Athlete Insights: Analysis of athlete demographics, age distribution, and performance.
Medal Prediction: Machine Learning models to predict medal outcomes based on past data.
Features
Streamlit Dashboard: A clean and intuitive interface for exploring data and predictions.
Dynamic Filters: Interactive filtering by country, year, sport, and athlete.
Advanced Visualizations: Charts and graphs powered by Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
Predictive Modeling: Machine Learning algorithms to analyze and predict outcomes.
Key Python Libraries Used
The project uses the following Python libraries:

Data Manipulation and Analysis:
pandas, numpy
Data Visualization:
matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, streamlit
Machine Learning:
scikit-learn, xgboost
Statistical Analysis:
scipy, statsmodels
Backend Framework:
streamlit
Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented
The following algorithms have been applied to analyze and predict trends in the data:

Linear Regression: For trend analysis and medal prediction.
Random Forest: For classification and feature importance.
K-Means Clustering: To group countries or athletes by similar characteristics.
XGBoost: To improve predictive accuracy in medal predictions.
Decision Trees: For simple and interpretable classification tasks.
